## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ We're a Brazilian IT company that works as a consultant, providing excellent know-how about different economic sectors and valuable products. The Rise was founded in early 2022 with a mission to change the perspective of technology in Brazil, believing in a more equitable country.

🌈 Currently, we have no public repositories in which the community can get involved.

👩‍💻 Useful resources may be found at https://rise.dev.br.

🍿 Fun fact: we started as an ed-tech company, then we got noticed that we are much more than this.

🧙 Remember, you can do everything you want.
